# MySQL

PMM Client collects metrics from MySQL and derivatives such as [Percona Server](percona-server.md), MariaDB, and [Amazon RDS](aws.md) with one of two methods:

- *slow query log*: Use on older MySQL variants, which have neither sampling nor *Performance Schema*, provides the most detail but can impact performance on heavily-loaded systems. On Percona Server the query sampling feature may reduce the performance impact.

- *Performance Schema*: generally a better choice for recent versions of other MySQL variants.

Which one you use depends on the version and variant of your MySQL instance.








To prevent data loss and performance issues, PMM does not automatically change MySQL configuration.

However, there are certain recommended settings that help maximize monitoring efficiency.

These recommendations depend on the variant and version of MySQL you are using, and mostly apply to very high loads.

MySQL with too many tables can lead to PMM Server overload due to the streaming of too much time series data. It can also lead to too many queries from `mysqld_exporter` causing extra load on MySQL. Therefore PMM Server disables most consuming `mysqld_exporter` collectors automatically if there are more than 1000 tables.





You can add configuration examples provided below to `my.cnf` and restart the server or change variables dynamically using the following syntax:

```sql
SET GLOBAL <var_name>=<var_value>
```

The following sample configurations can be used depending on the variant and version of MySQL:


## Slow query log

Recommended for:

- MySQL 5.1 to 5.5
- MariaDB 5.5
- Percona Server for MySQL
- XtraDB Cluster

Advantages

- Detailed information
- Low resource usage

Disadvantages

- Can affect the quality of monitoring data gathered by Query Analytics


1. Edit the database server's configuration file. E.g., for MySQL, `/etc/mysql/conf.d/mysql.cnf`.

2. Set values for these variables.

	```ini
	slow_query_log=ON
	log_output=file
	long_query_time=0
	log_slow_admin_statements=ON
	log_slow_slave_statements=ON
	```

3. Restart the server. E.g., for MySQL on Debian:

	```sh
	sudo systemctl restart mysql
	```

**Variables**

[`slow_query_log`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_slow_query_log) enables the slow query log. (Default: `OFF`)

[`long_query_time`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_long_query_time) is the slow query threshold in seconds (the definition of *slow*). (Default: `10`) In heavily-loaded applications, frequent fast queries can have a bigger impact on performance than rare slow queries. Setting this value to `0` means all queries are captured.

[`log_output`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_log_output) ensures the log is sent to a file. (Default: `file`)

[`log_slow_admin_statements`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_log_slow_admin_statements) includes the logging of administative statements. (Default: `OFF`)

**Percona Server for MySQL**

Depending on the amount of traffic, logging could become aggressive and resource consuming.

Percona Server for MySQL provides a way to throttle the level of intensity of the data capture without compromising information.

The most important variable is `log_slow_rate_limit`, which controls the *query sampling* in Percona Server for MySQL.

Details on that variable can be found [here](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server/LATEST/diagnostics/slow_extended.html#log_slow_rate_limit).

A possible problem with query sampling is that rare slow queries might not get captured at all.

To avoid this, use the `slow_query_log_always_write_time` variable to specify which queries should ignore sampling.

That is, queries with longer execution time will always be captured by the slow query log.

### Slow log file rotation

PMM will take care of rotating and removing old slow log files, only if you set the `--size-slow-logs` variable via [pmm-admin](../../details/commands/pmm-admin.md).

When the limit is reached, PMM will remove the previous old slow log file, rename the current file with the suffix `.old`, and execute the MySQL command `FLUSH LOGS`. It will only keep one old file. Older files will be deleted on the next iteration.

## Performance Schema

Starting from MySQL 5.6 (including Percona Server 5.6 and later), you can choose to parse query data from the *Performance Schema* instead of *slow query log*.

It is not available at all in MySQL versions prior to 5.6.

Starting from MySQL 5.6.6, *Performance Schema* is enabled by default.
*Performance Schema* is enabled by default in MySQL 5.6.6 and later versions.

In MariaDB 10.x Performance Schema is off by default






*Performance Schema* is not as data-rich as the *slow query log*, but it has all the critical data and is generally faster to parse.

If you are not running Percona Server (which supports sampling for the slow query log), then *Performance Schema* is a better alternative.


To use *Performance Schema*, set the `performance_schema` variable to `ON`:

```sql
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'performance_schema';
```

```
+--------------------+-------+
| Variable_name      | Value |
+--------------------+-------+
| performance_schema | ON    |
+--------------------+-------+
```

If this variable is not set to **ON**, add the the following lines to the
MySQL configuration file `my.cnf` and restart MySQL:

```ini
[mysql]
performance_schema=ON
```

If you are running a custom Performance Schema configuration, make sure that the
`statements_digest` consumer is enabled:

```sql
select * from setup_consumers;
```

```
+----------------------------------+---------+
| NAME                             | ENABLED |
+----------------------------------+---------+
| events_stages_current            | NO      |
| events_stages_history            | NO      |
| events_stages_history_long       | NO      |
| events_statements_current        | YES     |
| events_statements_history        | YES     |
| events_statements_history_long   | NO      |
| events_transactions_current      | NO      |
| events_transactions_history      | NO      |
| events_transactions_history_long | NO      |
| events_waits_current             | NO      |
| events_waits_history             | NO      |
| events_waits_history_long        | NO      |
| global_instrumentation           | YES     |
| thread_instrumentation           | YES     |
| statements_digest                | YES     |
+----------------------------------+---------+
15 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

!!! alert alert-info "Note"

    If certain instruments are not enabled, you will not see the corresponding graphs in the MySQL Performance Schema dashboard.  To enable full instrumentation, set the option `--performance_schema_instrument` to `'%=on'` when starting the MySQL server:

    ```sh
    mysqld --performance-schema-instrument='%=on'
    ```

If you are running any MariaDB version, there is no Explain or Example data shown by default in Query Analytics. A workaround is to run this SQL command:

```sql
UPDATE performance_schema.setup_instruments SET ENABLED = 'YES', TIMED = 'YES'
WHERE NAME LIKE 'statement/%';
UPDATE performance_schema.setup_consumers SET ENABLED = 'YES'
WHERE NAME LIKE '%statements%';
```

This option can cause additional overhead and should be used with care.






If the instance is already running, configure the QAN agent to collect data
from *Performance Schema*:

1. Open the *PMM Query Analytics* dashboard.

2. Click the *Settings* button.

3. Open the *Settings* section.

4. Select `Performance Schema` in the *Collect from* drop-down list.

5. Click *Apply* to save changes.

If you are adding a new monitoring instance with the `pmm-admin` tool, use the
`--query-source='perfschema'` option:

Run this command as root or by using the `sudo` command

```sh
pmm-admin add mysql --username=pmm --password=pmmpassword --query-source='perfschema' ps-mysql 127.0.0.1:3306
```

For more information, run `pmm-admin add mysql --help`.


### MySQL 5.6+, MariaDB 10.0+

If you are running MySQL 5.6+ or MariaDB 10.0+

```ini
innodb_monitor_enable=all
performance_schema=ON
```


## Percona Server, XtraDB Cluster

If you are running Percona Server (or XtraDB Cluster), configure the *slow query log* to capture all queries and enable sampling. This will provide the most amount of information with the lowest overhead.

 ```ini
 log_output=file
 slow_query_log=ON
 long_query_time=0
 log_slow_rate_limit=100
 log_slow_rate_type=query
 log_slow_verbosity=full
 log_slow_admin_statements=ON
 log_slow_slave_statements=ON
 slow_query_log_always_write_time=1
 slow_query_log_use_global_control=all
 innodb_monitor_enable=all
 userstat=1
 ```


## Create MySQL user account

When adding a MySQL instance to monitoring, you can specify the MySQL
server superuser account credentials.  However, monitoring with the superuser
account is not advised. Itâ€™s better to create a user with only the necessary
privileges for collecting data.

As an example, the user `pmm` can be created manually with the necessary
privileges and pass its credentials when adding the instance.

To enable complete MySQL instance monitoring, a command similar to the
following is recommended:

```sh
sudo pmm-admin add mysql --username pmm --password <password>
```

Of course this user should have necessary privileges for collecting data. If
the `pmm` user already exists, you can grant the required privileges as
follows:

```sql
CREATE USER 'pmm'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'pass' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 10;
GRANT SELECT, PROCESS, SUPER, REPLICATION CLIENT, RELOAD ON *.* TO 'pmm'@'localhost';
```




## Adding MySQL Service Monitoring

You add MySQL services (Metrics and Query Analytics) with the following command:

### USAGE

```sh
pmm-admin add mysql --query-source=slowlog --username=pmm --password=pmm
```

where username and password are credentials for the monitored MySQL access, which will be used locally on the database host. Additionally, two positional arguments can be appended to the command line flags: a service name to be used by PMM, and a service address. If not specified, they are substituted automatically as `<node>-mysql` and `127.0.0.1:3306`.

The command line and the output of this command may look as follows:

```sh
pmm-admin add mysql --query-source=slowlog --username=pmm --password=pmm sl-mysql 127.0.0.1:3306
```

```
MySQL Service added.
Service ID  : /service_id/a89191d4-7d75-44a9-b37f-a528e2c4550f
Service name: sl-mysql
```

!!! alert alert-info "Note"

    There are two possible sources for query metrics provided by MySQL to get data for the Query Analytics: the [slow log](#slow-log-settings) and the [Performance Schema](#performance-schema).

    The `--query-source` option can be used to specify it, either as `slowlog` (it is also used by default if nothing specified) or as `perfschema`:

    ```sh
    pmm-admin add mysql --username=pmm --password=pmm --query-source=perfschema ps-mysql 127.0.0.1:3306
    ```

Beside positional arguments shown above you can specify service name and service address with the following flags: `--service-name`, `--host` (the hostname or IP address of the service), and `--port` (the port number of the service). If both flag and positional argument are present, flag gains higher priority. Here is the previous example modified to use these flags:

```sh
pmm-admin add mysql --username=pmm --password=pmm --service-name=ps-mysql --host=127.0.0.1 --port=3306
```

!!! alert alert-info "Note"

    It is also possible to add MySQL instance using UNIX socket with use of a special `--socket` flag followed with the path to a socket without username, password and network type:

    ```sh
    pmm-admin add mysql --socket=/var/path/to/mysql/socket
    ```

After adding the service you can view MySQL metrics or examine the added node on the new PMM Inventory Dashboard.

## MySQL InnoDB Metrics

Collecting metrics and statistics for graphs increases overhead.  You can keep
collecting and graphing low-overhead metrics all the time, and enable
high-overhead metrics only when troubleshooting problems.

InnoDB metrics provide detailed insight about InnoDB operation.  Although you
can select to capture only specific counters, their overhead is low even when
they all are enabled all the time. To enable all InnoDB metrics, set the
global variable `innodb_monitor_enable` to `all`:

```sql
SET GLOBAL innodb_monitor_enable=all
```
